It’s December 2013. My Pebble buzzes.

"Congratulations, you have been accepted to the University of Waterloo!"

Ohshitohshitohshit did I make it? Wait, why am I surprised. Of course I would get accepted into Computer Science at Waterloo. With 3 hackathon victories and 5 side projects under my belt, and knowledge of 15 programming languages, I had all it took to receive an early offer.

Soon enough, the numbers were in. Waterloo CS got more applicants than ever, with only 1 in 5 applicants getting a spot. As a proud member of the 20%, I was even more hyped up for the fall.

Okay, I don’t think I need to go over every little detail of first year, but I finished 1A with a 95% average. I got 15 interviews during 1B, including 3 from the Big 4. Needless to say, I took one of the Big 4 offers, which I will not disclose for anonymity reasons.

Life was great. Until today, when my pebble buzzed again.

*Hack the North Decision.*

I opened the email. They rejected me. WHAT. Did they even send it to the right person? Foul play was involved, clearly.

<blockquote>
  After all, I work at a fucking big 4 company, have had offers from pretty much all of the big 4, and I can’t get into a shitty fucking hackathon located on campus at my own school. What a load of shit.
</blockquote>

Turns out everyone else in my team got in. How was that possible? I was, literally, "the" guy who was going to carry them. None of the other three had close to as much experience as I did. Two of them were incoming first-year Laurier BBA students, who only wanted to stuff their resume. The other team member was my girlfriend who was in Applied Health Sciences with no prior programming experience. It didn't make sense to me how the three other girls made it and I didn't. I clearly had superior technical skills and I actually had a passion for technology. Only one explanation made sense - Hack the North must have been biased against males.

I was furious. And I was not the only one. A reddit post on /r/uwaterloo with the same question quickly got 100+ comments and gained tons of traction. Lots of super-smart developers, "mostly" male, had been rejected. I asked around how I could improve my chances of getting in and one person replied, "Have you tried changing genders?" So much for competence over diversity.

After I came to terms with my rejection, I realized that HTN wasn’t the right place for me anyway. By turning away this many smart people, they’ve proven that they don’t represent UW’s values of "Ideas Start Here." More like "Ideas End Here." To any Hack the North organizers reading this: I hear there’s a high school down University Ave that would make a great venue for Hack the North 2016.
