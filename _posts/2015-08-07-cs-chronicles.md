Many kids don't know what they want to do when they grow up, many people in university are still unsure about what they're doing. I was different, however. My mom and dad were both C-Level executives in CSC, and from the moment I was born, they knew, and I knew, that I would become a leading figure in CSC.

It was my third year in CS Double Degree, and it was also the term before my fateful coop at CSC. This term was important for me: it was the quarter where CSC needed to pick a new CEO, and I wasn't going to let some wrinkly old dude take it. CSC was my turf, and I knew I had to step it up to the max if I wanted this position. I knew I could do it. After all, I'm the best. I'm the greatest. I'm fucking X.

On Jobmine, I only applied for jobs at CSC, all three of them. I wasn't going to work at the Big 4 again, like all my other colleagues wanted to. I wasn't going to work 60 hours a week doing monkey work for some skinny attractive dude with 30 different suits. I wasn't going to sell my dreams, my pride, for some $1000/wk salary. I wanted to be a motherfucking GOAT. And I knew I would be, since I'm the motherfucking best.

The night before the interview, I wasn't nervous like the other applicants. I wasn't preparing interview answers or practicing. I grew up learning this shit, I was born and grew up a CSC. I spent the night staring at a picture of the current CEO, JACK BROWN, unblinking. I would succeed him, I would destroy him, I would, in Tony Hawk's words, "make him my bitch."

At dawn I put on my finest fedora and suit, and walked out the door to my interview. I could not afford to be late for this, and waited hours to be called up in CECA. In the meantime, I stared down the other interviewees, intimidating them, and the moment one of them looked away, I knew that I had won. I would destroy them just like how I will destroy JACK BROWN.

I was called down, and shook hands with the interviewer. Normally, any pleb would continue the interview just answering questions and looking like a fool. I, on the other hand, had a strategy.

I took off my fedora, and inside the fedora's cap, were my various CSC Scout badges. I told him about my time as a boy in the CSC Scouts, about the CSC Scout Rule of D's, about the techniques I learned to earn each badge. The twist n pull, the tickler, the screwdriver, the double knot rope and the cowboy. I spent 25 minutes dominating the interview with my CSC Scout knowledge, proving my worth without having to answer any of his BS.

It was clear that the interviewer was impressed. However, I still haven't won him over.  He asked one question before the interview was over:
<blockquote>
  "What was the ballsiest thing you've ever done?"
</blockquote>
It was too early to unveil my secret technique, but I knew I needed to if I wanted the job. "I can show you right now," I replied, looking soulfully into his family jewels. I stretched my body over the table. "Bb your eyes are an ocean," I said.
<blockquote>
  "I sea men" the interviewer whispered, as my lips came close to his.
</blockquote>
Suddenly a knock. Shit got real when we realized another interviewee was at the door.
