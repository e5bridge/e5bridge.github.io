description: I never would have thought that AFM would change my life. A tale of living, learning, and networking.

May 6th, 2014. This was the day that forever changed my life. I received my admission offer to the prestigious Accounting and Financial Management program at the University of Waterloo.

I've dreamt of this day since I was 5 years old. My father was an accountant and my mother was a financial manager. Notice how I said 'was'. Unfortunately, they worked at Enron and Arthur Anderson, respectively, and lost their jobs in late 2001.

Anyways, I got a little sidetracked. I recall compulsively refreshing the admission page on Quest. Around noon time, my friend Kenneth told me he received an offer. I stopped everything I was doing at the time and clicked F5 one more time. Next thing you know, the acceptance message popped up.

Fast forward four months, I moved into V1 residence for the AFM Living & Learning program. I immediately networked with my floor mates and became good acquaintances. I felt like I really made a connection with my future classmates, specifically on LinkedIn. It seemed like everybody was a Vice-President at their school's DECA chapter, treasurer of student council, and Math tutor. I find it ridiculous how I had the same activities as them.

I'm not going to comment about the Arts Orientation week because it was pretty lame. On the other hand, Accounting and Finance Orientation Week was out of this world! I've never had so many networking opportunities in my life. In fact, it was a bit intimidating at first. I was scared to talk to others because their resume was so much better than mine.

I managed to pull myself together just in time for the Clubs Crawl night. Note to incoming AFM students: this is the single most important night of your first year. I networked my heart out that night. I don't remember exactly what happened that night, but the next morning I woke up to 15 business cards scattered over my super small V1 bed. Two weeks later, I received offers from each of the prestigious Big 4 (UWAC, ACE, DECA, GCC). I ended up selecting DECA and GCC, as they provided the most opportunity for personal and career growth.

I had a 91% average in high school, so I thought I was pretty set for academics at Waterloo. It turned out I couldn't have been more right. AFM courses are a joke. In MATH 109, I learned how to factor. In ECON 101, I learned how to fill in multiple choice sheets. Taking INTST 101 is like when you have to babysit your brother for 3 hours. It sucks and you're on the phone the entire time. AFM 101, well, there's a reason why it's called 101.

Least, but definitely last was AFM 131, the infamous Mike's Bikes course. I learned how to sell bikes with innovative features such as built-in calorie tracking, reversible wheels, etc. My highlight of the course was definitely my professor. He was awesome! Have a happy retirement 'Spongebob'. At the end of the day, I finished with a solid 3.95 GPA. I didn't get 4.0 because I didn't show enough work on my MATH 109 exam.

In my honest opinion, the most difficult part about my first term was how I had 15 hours of class time. That means I had a lot of free time, which sucked because I wasted most of it. And if time equals money, then I wasted a lot of money.

My first term can be summarized in two words: 500+ connections.

To be continued...
